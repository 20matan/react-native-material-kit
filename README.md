This is a port of [MaterialKit](https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit) (written in Swift) to Objective-C, so that it can be used in React Native projects, as a static library.

Thanks to the great work of [@nghialv](https://github.com/nghialv)!

It's the very begining of the project, few components are ready for now.
