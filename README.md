# [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) components for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native)

[![DUB](https://img.shields.io/dub/l/vibe-d.svg)](http://mit-license.org)

This is a port of [MaterialKit](https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit) (written in Swift) to Objective-C, so that it can be used in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) projects, as a static library.

Thanks to the great work of [@nghialv](https://github.com/nghialv)!
